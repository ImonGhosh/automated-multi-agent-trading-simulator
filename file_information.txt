traders.py
mcp_params.py :
The parameters for all mcp servers are defined here

templates.py :
The instructions and message prompts for Researcher Agent and Trader Agent are defined here

accounts.py :
The account management logic is defined here (with access to SQLLite database for performing read/write operations)

accounts_server.py :
Wrapper MCP Server for using the accounts.py (Account Management System) as an MCP Tool

accounts_client.py :
Wrapper MCP Client that calls the accounts_server.py MCP Server to access the accounts_py tool
This is mainly required for making resource calls (as resource calls for custom MCP Servers require custom MCP Client

market.py :
This class is used to fetch and store/cache the market data that is retrieved by Polygon API
This ensures that subsequent market calls on same date does not require multiple API requests and can be retrieved quickly from cache

market_server.py
Wrapper MCP Server for using the market.py (Market data) as an MCP Tool

push_server.py
Wrapper MCP Server for using Push Notification Functionality using Pushover

database.py 
This class contains the database write/read utility methods (Account data, market data, logs)

accounts.db
The actual SQLLite database which stores all the information

traders.py
Contains the Trader() class which contains the code to actually create the Researcher/Trader agents and run them 

reset.py
This class contains the reset() method which resets the accounts and strategy for the 4 registered Agents
This reset() needs to be run before starting the app for the first time

app.py
This class has the Gradio UI code for rendering of the application

trading_floor.py
This class creates the listed Trader objects and evokes run on all of them asynchronously
This actually kicks of the agents and the trading starts. This is reflected on the UI.
This class also handles which llm models to use, sleeping strategy, whether to run trading when market is closed etc

tracers.py
Custom Tracer Class (LogTracer) which overrides Open AI Agents SDK's trace/span methods to incorporate custom logic (extract the agent name from original Trace ID and write to log)
This ensures that these callbacks are called by the Open AI global tracer each time a Trace or Span starts or ends
For this to work, 
The custom class must extend the base class "TracingProcessor"
Just before the processes are actually started, add "add_trace_processor(LogTracer())" to inform Agents SDK to use this custom tracer
